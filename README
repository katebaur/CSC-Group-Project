We have three categories: Tops, Bottoms and Dresses
In each category we had three styles and three different colors for each
Users can go back by typing BACK or go to home page by typing HOME
Users can check shopping cart at any time by typing SC
Users can check out in home page by typing CHECKOUT
Users have a choice to pay with cash or card and whether they want their receipt or not
